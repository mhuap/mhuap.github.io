Today, the conference has grown to be a series that is aimed\n      at supporting current student leaders, as well as expanding and diversifying LGBTQ+ student\n      leadership on all three campuses.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>The goals of <i>Lead with Pride</i> are to provide students with the opportunity to engage in\n      vital conversations around LGBTQ+ leadership; develop an understanding of anti-oppression\n      work; practice self-care; and learn tangible, hands-on skills to support student organizing\n      and leadership.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>The <i>Lead With Pride</i> co-chairs asked me to design a logo\n      in time for their sixth annual <i><a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/329467091289285/'>Lead with Pride: Executive Jumpstart conference</a></i>.\n      The logo was also used for the <i>Lead With Pride</i> February conference.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The Process</h3>\n\n      <h4>1. The Brief</h4>\n\n      <p>I started by having conversations with the co-chairs about the values\n      and principles they wanted to emphasize this year, and any aesthetic direction they had in mind.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Key concepts:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Inner strength</li>\n        <li>Transferable skills</li>\n        <li>Succeeding in queer spaces and outside</li>\n        <li>Networking - meeting people, connecting</li>\n        <li>Community contributes to individual and vice versa</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Key aesthetic traits:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Bold</li>\n        <li>Fun</li>\n        <li>Professional</li>\n        <li>Queer (purple/pink/rainbow)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>2. Moodboards + Colors</h4>\n\n      <p>Firstly, I reminded the clients of imagery ideas they had brought up in conversation,\n      and presented a collection of existing conference logos for context.</p>\n\n      <p>Then, I offered 2 options for aesthetic directions</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Curvy hand-lettering: more fun and playful.</li>\n        <li>Modern & Bold: Geometric in nature - more professional but can be made fun by use of bold, saturated colors. </li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <figure>\n        <img src={step1a} alt='Moodboards'/>\n        <figcaption>Moodboard and reference slides I presented to the client</figcaption>\n      </figure>\n\n      <p>I presented 2 options for color palettes:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Lively Rainbow: bright, neon, from a range of hues - based on the visual relationship between rainbows and queerness.</li>\n        <li>Bi lighting: Bisexual colors - based on the modern trend of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual_lighting\">bisexual lighting</a> used in film and television.</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <figure>\n        <img src={step1b} alt='Color palettes'/>\n        <figcaption>Color palette slides I presented to the client.</figcaption>\n      </figure>\n\n\n      <h4>3. Sketches</h4>\n\n      <figure>\n        <img src={sketches} alt='Collage of sketches'/>\n        <figcaption>Collage of sketches I presented to the client.

Final Options</h4>\n\n      <figure>\n        <img src={final} alt='Final 4 logo options'/>\n        <figcaption>Final 4 options based on 2 sketches.

I used axios to make the call to the backend</p>\n\n      <p><strong>Backend: </strong>I used cheerio.js to scrape the tweet from twitter.com\n      via Node.js in Google Cloud Functions. I also isolated the exact html elements I needed with cheerio.js.</p>\n\n      <p>I chose to use Next.js out of curiosity for the framework and desire to experiment with it.\n      In order to avoid CORS restrictions when web-scraping, I had to handle the webscraping with cheerio.js which\n      runs server-side. I wanted to host my site on Github Pages, which only supports hosting static HTML pages,\n      so I used Google Cloud Functions to run cheerio.js in a Node.js serverless function.</p>\n\n      <h3>What's Next</h3>\n\n      <p>Currently, I am happy with the deployed version of tweet-img but this is a minimum viable product -\n      I have many plans for upcoming features. Not to mention, it only supports\n      <a href='https://github.com/mhuap/tweet-img#tweet-support'>certain kinds of tweets</a> at the moment.</p>\n\n      <p>Future customization features will include backgrounds using gradients or an uploaded image,\n      and letting the tweet content stand alone without a white background.</p>\n\n    </Project>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default TweetImg;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
